          I have recently built my first P.C. back in spring 2020. I plan on
          building another P.C. in the next few years. I learned from YouTube
          videos and P.C. Part Picker. Everything went together without any
          issues and I learned a lot about what each component does. I highly
          recommend building your own P.C. for learning about computers as well
          as save you some money.
          The parts I used are the following...
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Rog Strix B-450f motherboard</li>
            <li>AMD Ryzen 5 3600 Processor</li>
            <li>16GB of DDR4 R.A.M.</li>
            <li>500GB M.2 SSD</li>
            <li>ROG Strix RTX 2060 Graphics Card</li>
            <li>650watt Power Unit</li>
            <li>Phanteks P-300 Case (white)</li>
            <li>Plently of RGB :)</li>
          </ul>
